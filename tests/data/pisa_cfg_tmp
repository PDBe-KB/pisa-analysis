#   When used in command-prompt mode, this file must be specified     #
#       as last argument in thecommand line, or pointed out by        #

#    This file may be also used to configure the QtPISA graphical     #
#   application, by either reading it using the "Load CFG" button   #
#  in PISA Settings Dialog, or by running QtPISA from command prompt  #
#    with this file as the only command-line argument. QtPISA needs   #
#           to be configure only once after installation.             #

#  SESSION_PREFIX is prefix for the names of session directories
#  created in DATA_PATH ("pisrv_" is used by default). Be sure to
#  have unique prefixes for each configuration file that is invoked
#  from a different user login or apache service. Session directories
#  are regularly removed from DATA_PATH, and SESSION_PREFIX allows
#  one to avoid permission conflicts between different services.

#     The following configuration parameters are needed only for jspisa,
#   which is a web-server application. They may be ignored or even removed
#        from configuration files for command-prompt pisa and qtpisa.

#  PDB_DIR is used only by jspisa (web-server). It must
#  give absolute path to PDB directory.
