#   When used in command-prompt mode, this file must be specified     #
#       as last argument in thecommand line, or pointed out by        #
#              PISA_CONF_FILE environmental variable.                 #

#    This file may be also used to configure the QtPISA graphical     #
#   application, by either reading it using the "Load CFG" button   #
#  in PISA Settings Dialog, or by running QtPISA from command prompt  #
#    with this file as the only command-line argument. QtPISA needs   #

#  DOWNLOAD_URL is used only in QtPISA. It must give a valid base URL

#  SESSION_PREFIX is prefix for the names of session directories

#  from a different user login or apache service. Session directories
#  are regularly removed from DATA_PATH, and SESSION_PREFIX allows
