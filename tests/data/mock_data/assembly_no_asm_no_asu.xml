    Results are not available due to the following reason: Overlapping
    structures. This means that crystallographic data is not correct or
    precise, and overlapping symmetry mates of molecules were found at
    crystal reconstruction. PISA does not attempt to perform an
    assembly analysis if there are problematic interfaces. Overlapping
    interfaces are marked by star in the list of interfaces.
