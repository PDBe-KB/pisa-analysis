#  SESSION_PREFIX is prefix for the names of session directories
#  created in DATA_PATH ("pisrv_" is used by default). Be sure to
#  have unique prefixes for each configuration file that is invoked
#  from a different user login or apache service. Session directories
#  are regularly removed from DATA_PATH, and SESSION_PREFIX allows
#  one to avoid permission conflicts between different services.
